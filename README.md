# css-my-site
A web site which made with html and css. While I was doing this site, I found the chance of practicing html and remembering css. Also I wanted to share that I did this site according to the Sean Halpin's site (https://web.archive.org/web/20180819202235js_/http://seanhalpin.io/) under the guidance of Dr. Angela Yu.
